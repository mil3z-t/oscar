# oscar
potentially a file manager

<h1>About<h1>
Oscar is my first actual project like ever!
It's made with c++, and for the most part does what other file managers do.
(It's also named after my dog :D )

<h1>Commands<h1>
<h2>Here is a list of current commands<h2>
     create/
     toss/
     rename/
<h2>Soon to added commands<h2>
    move/
    show (like ls, but shows it in a tree format)/
    hide (makes files and directories private)/
    hshow (works like regular show, but also shows hidden files & directories)/
