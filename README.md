# oscar
potentially a file manager

<h1>About<h1>
Oscar is my first actual project like ever!
It's made with c++, and for the most part does what other file managers do.
(It's also named after my dog :D )

<h1>Commands<h1>
--> Here is a list of current commands\n
    -> create\n
    -> toss\n
    -> rename\n
--> Soon to added commands
    -> move\n
    -> show (like ls, but shows it in a tree format)\n
    -> hide (makes files and directories private)\n
    -> hshow (works like regular show, but also shows hidden files & directories)\n
